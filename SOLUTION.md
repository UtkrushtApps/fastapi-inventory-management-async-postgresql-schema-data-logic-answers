# Solution Steps

1. Define the SQLAlchemy declarative model for the 'products' table, including fields for id, name, description, quantity, price, created_at, and updated_at, and enforce a unique constraint on product name.

2. Create an Alembic migration to generate the actual products table in PostgreSQL, reflecting all fields and constraints from your model.

3. Set up an async SQLAlchemy engine and session factory to connect FastAPI to the PostgreSQL database asynchronously, using the asyncpg driver.

4. Implement async CRUD logic: a function to insert new products with uniqueness error handling, and a function to fetch all products from the database using AsyncSession.

5. Ensure all database interactions use SQLAlchemy async syntax and best practices for FastAPI integrations.
